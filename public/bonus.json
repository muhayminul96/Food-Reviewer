    "blogText": "The React Context API allows a React project to generate global variables that may be passed around. This is an alternative to prop drilling, which involves passing props from grandparents to kid to parent, and so on. Context api is also marketed as a better, lighter way to Redux state management. .\r\n"

    "title": "What is semantic tag?",
    "blogText": "Semantic HTML, also known as semantic markup, is HTML that adds meaning to a web page rather than merely making it seem pretty.A <p> tag, for example, denotes that the contained text is a paragraph. Because people understand what paragraphs are and how to display them, this is both semantic and presentational. Tags like <b> and <i> on the other hand, do not have any semantic value. They just specify how the text should appear (bold or italic), not the markup's meaning. \r\n"

    "title": "What is the difference between inline and inline-block elements?",
    "blogText": "Inline elements: left and right margins and padding are respected, but top and bottom margins and padding are not. Inline elements cannot have a width and height defined that allows other elements to sit to their left and right. Important side comments on this may be found here. Other hand, Inline-block elements: Allow additional components to reside to the left and right of inline-block elements while maintaining top and bottom margins and padding. \r\n"
